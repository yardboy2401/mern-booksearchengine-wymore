# MERN: Book Search Engine-Wymore

## Your Task
The task is to take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

## Languages Used
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose ODM
- GraphQL/Apollo-Server
- React.js

## Project Notes

App is working well after conversion to GraphQL and Apollo-Server with new schemas defined for typeDefs and resolvers. Functionality is good and has been tested on Heroku deployed application. Remote database is also working on Mongo Atlas for the deployed App.
